      <title>You can have SASS asset pipelines in Hugo</title>

      <description>Which lets you build a CSS stylesheet via something like:
{{ $style := resources.Get &amp;#34;css/main.scss&amp;#34; | resources.ToCSS }} &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;#34;stylesheet&amp;#34; href=&amp;#34;{{ $style.Permalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt; This is rather nice as you get the usual live reloading functionality when using hugo server. In previous Hugo projects, I had a separate process for rebuilding CSS, which can now be factored away.
This feature is part of Hugo&amp;rsquo;s asset pipeline functionality and has been available since v0.</description>

      <title>About text fragments</title>

      <description>Modern versions of Chrome and Edge support Text Fragments, which let you specify a text snippet in the URL fragment that the browser can highlight (or bring to the user&amp;rsquo;s attention in another way).
For example, opening https://wicg.github.io/scroll-to-text-fragment/#abstract:~:text=user%20agent%20can%20quickly%20emphasise in Chrome will open the page with &amp;ldquo;user agent can quickly emphasise&amp;rdquo; highlighted:
  Note the :~:text=$query in the URL.
There&amp;rsquo;s a Google-authored Chrome plugin that eases the process of building one of these URLs.</description>

      <title>Renaming a Terraform module is dangerous</title>
      <link>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/renaming-a-terraform-module-leads-to-resource-recreation/</link>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/renaming-a-terraform-module-leads-to-resource-recreation/</guid>
      <description>As the state file uses the module name in identifiers and so a module rename causes Terraform to think all existing resources need to be destroyed and recreated.
You can avoid such needless destruction by editing the state file manually to correct the identifiers.
It might be possible to use terraform mv although I didn&amp;rsquo;t use that approach today.</description>

      <description>The file that controls where the default ubuntu user on an Ubuntu EC2 instance is /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users which has contents:
# User rules for ubuntu ubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL def f(a: int) -&amp;gt; int: return None As you can see, the default ubuntu user has password-less, sudo access.

 Before putting a project or incomplete task away, make notes of what the next thing was that you were going to work on. This lets you bypass that 10 minute orientation getting back into the project the next time you pick it up.
 This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve done for a while.
There&amp;rsquo;s various other ways of doing the same thing, such as:
 Leaving a failing test Leaving an incomplete sentence  In my Trello cards, I like to regularly add comments saying:</description>
