      <title>OpenDNS provide free porn-blocking DNS servers</title>
      <link>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/opendns-provide-free-pornblocking-dns-servers/</link>

      <description>Installation requires switching the DNS servers of your router or device to use the OpenDNS ones. If you create an account, you can customise the degree of filtering and view some simple stats.
This is useful for home networking when you have kids. Unfortunately, the Virgin Media Hub 3.0 I have doesn&amp;rsquo;t support custom DNS settings - you need to use it as a modem with a separate router to achieve that.</description>

      <title>AWS Availability Zones have counter-intuitive IDs</title>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/aws-availability-zones-have-counterintuitive-ids/</guid>
      <description>Today, the AWS Service Health Dashboard referred to an Availability Zone in a way I wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with:
 3:52 AM PDT We are experiencing instance connectivity issues in a single Availability Zone (euw2-az2) in the EU-WEST-2 Region.
 See:
  Here &amp;ldquo;euw2-az2&amp;rdquo; is the &amp;ldquo;Zone ID&amp;rdquo; of the Availability Zone, and the mapping from Zone ID to the more familiar Zone Name is non-obvious. See, for example:
$ aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region eu-west-2 | jq -r &amp;#39;.</description>

      <title>You can rate-limit issues using a Sentry DSN</title>
      <link>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/you-can-ratelimit-issues-using-a-sentry-dsn/</link>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/you-can-ratelimit-issues-using-a-sentry-dsn/</guid>
      <description>If you want to manage how your event quota is consumed with Sentry, you can apply rate limits at the DSN level.
  This lets you apply different rate limiting settings for different parts of your application by using separate DSNs.
See Sentry&amp;rsquo;s docs on the subject.</description>

      <title>How to list pages with matching tag in Hugo</title>
      <link>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/how-to-list-pages-with-matching-tag-in-hugo/</link>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/how-to-list-pages-with-matching-tag-in-hugo/</guid>
      <description>In a detail template, you can grab a post&amp;rsquo;s tags with {{ .GetTerms &amp;quot;tags&amp;quot; }}. You can then loop over this and fetch a list of pages with each tag, excluding the current post:
{{ range $tag_pages }} {{ $related_tag_pages := where .Pages &amp;#34;Title&amp;#34; &amp;#34;!=&amp;#34; $.Title }} {{ if $related_tag_pages }} &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other posts about &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{ .Permalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;{{ .Title | markdownify }}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; {{ range $related_tag_pages }} &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{ .RelPermalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;{{ .</description>

      <title>About `:help macvim`</title>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/about-help-macvim/</guid>
      <description>MacVim ships with its own help files, accessed via:

      <title>About Vim&#39;s `:diffthis` command</title>
      <link>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/about-vims-diffthis-command/</link>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/about-vims-diffthis-command/</guid>
      <description>You can manually compare two more open buffers by running:
:windo diffthisThis is an alternative to opening the files with vimdiff. One advantage is that you compare buffers that aren&amp;rsquo;t files (eg text pasted from the clipboard).
Further reading:
 There&amp;rsquo;s some useful info in the &amp;ldquo;Comparing buffers with vimdiff&amp;rdquo; screencast. :help :diffthis  </description>

      <title>About the stationery pad feature in Finder</title>
      <link>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/about-the-stationery-pad-feature-in-finder/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 10:30:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/about-the-stationery-pad-feature-in-finder/</guid>
      <description>If you use Finder to mark a file as a &amp;ldquo;stationery pad&amp;rdquo; then apps will open a copy of the file. The original file will effectively act as a template.
You can set this flag from the Get Info Finder dialogue:
  This only works when opening a file from Finder, so not that much use to people who live in iTerm (like me).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s an image optimizer for PNG files. It&amp;rsquo;s available via Homebrew for MacOS and works like:
$ pngcrush -ow screenshot.png where -ow means the original image file will be overwritten.
I&amp;rsquo;ve integrated it into the til_screenshot.sh helper script used by this repo.</description>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/asana-has-some-magic-search-terms/</guid>
      <description>If you use the &amp;ldquo;Search this project&amp;rdquo; widget (via the &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; link on the right-hand side of the project view), you can search for:
 &amp;quot;nobody&amp;quot; to see unassigned tickets &amp;quot;not me&amp;quot; to see tickets assigned to anyone but you    Found via https://forum.asana.com/t/search-for-unassigned-tasks/4770

      <title>You can have SASS asset pipelines in Hugo</title>
      <link>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/you-can-have-sass-asset-pipelines-in-hugo/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/you-can-have-sass-asset-pipelines-in-hugo/</guid>
      <description>Which lets you build a CSS stylesheet via something like:
{{ $style := resources.Get &amp;#34;css/main.scss&amp;#34; | resources.ToCSS }} &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;#34;stylesheet&amp;#34; href=&amp;#34;{{ $style.Permalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt; This is rather nice as you get the usual live reloading functionality when using hugo server. In previous Hugo projects, I had a separate process for rebuilding CSS, which can now be factored away.
This feature is part of Hugo&amp;rsquo;s asset pipeline functionality and has been available since v0.</description>

      <title>About text fragments</title>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/about-text-fragments/</guid>
      <description>Modern versions of Chrome and Edge support Text Fragments, which let you specify a text snippet in the URL fragment that the browser can highlight (or bring to the user&amp;rsquo;s attention in another way).
For example, opening https://wicg.github.io/scroll-to-text-fragment/#abstract:~:text=user%20agent%20can%20quickly%20emphasise in Chrome will open the page with &amp;ldquo;user agent can quickly emphasise&amp;rdquo; highlighted:
  Note the :~:text=$query in the URL.
There&amp;rsquo;s a Google-authored Chrome plugin that eases the process of building one of these URLs.</description>

      <title>Renaming a Terraform module is dangerous</title>
      <link>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/renaming-a-terraform-module-leads-to-resource-recreation/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/renaming-a-terraform-module-leads-to-resource-recreation/</guid>
      <description>As the state file uses the module name in identifiers and so a module rename causes Terraform to think all existing resources need to be destroyed and recreated.
You can avoid such needless destruction by editing the state file manually to correct the identifiers.
It might be possible to use terraform mv although I didn&amp;rsquo;t use that approach today.</description>

 Before putting a project or incomplete task away, make notes of what the next thing was that you were going to work on. This lets you bypass that 10 minute orientation getting back into the project the next time you pick it up.
 This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve done for a while.
There&amp;rsquo;s various other ways of doing the same thing, such as:
 Leaving a failing test Leaving an incomplete sentence  In my Trello cards, I like to regularly add comments saying:</description>

      <description>You can do searches like:
from:frankieboyle min_faves:10000 to see, for example, the best tweets from a given account. It works really well &amp;ndash; you just need to pick an appropriate minimum value for the account.
Examples:
 https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Afrankieboyle%20min_faves%3A10000 https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Afesshole%20min_faves%3A400  There&amp;rsquo;s also a min_retweets filter which can be used for a similar purpose.</description>
