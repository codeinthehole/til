      <description>Minimising:
  ⌘ + m minimises the active application window.
  Window icon appears in Dock.
  Selecting application via the ⌘ + tab application switcher doesn&amp;rsquo;t restore window.
  Hiding:
  ⌘ + h hides all windows of active application.
  ⌘ + ⌥ + h hides all windows of all applications except the active one (useful).
  Window icon not show in Dock.</description>

      <description>Which are:
 alt + - for an en-dash (–); shift + alt + - for an em-dash (—);  You can always get them from the ctrl + cmd + space character picker but good to know quicker alternatives.
Don&amp;rsquo;t seem to work in MacVim though.</description>

      <description>If you use Finder to mark a file as a &amp;ldquo;stationery pad&amp;rdquo; then apps will open a copy of the file. The original file will effectively act as a template.
You can set this flag from the Get Info Finder dialogue:
  This only works when opening a file from Finder, so not that much use to people who live in iTerm (like me).</description>
