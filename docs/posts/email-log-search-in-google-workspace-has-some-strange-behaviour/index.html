            <h1>Email Log Search in Google Workspace has some strange behaviour</h1>
        </header><p>Google Workspace admins can use the <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2618874?hl=en">Email Log Search</a> feature to
inspect emails sent and received by Gmail. However beware that the email detail
page isn&rsquo;t consistent: it can change depending on which filters were used to
find it.</p>
<p>If you filter by sender email address, the email detail page shows the correct
recipients (including those added by Gmail&rsquo;s default routing rules).</p>
<p>However if you filter by recipient, the email detail page is the same except the
additional recipients aren&rsquo;t shown.</p>
<p>This is quite confusing.</p>
<p>There is a note in the docs that describes something similar:</p>
<figure><img src="/images/google-email-logs-note.png"
    alt="Google Email Logs note">
</figure>

<p>Ultimately, if you&rsquo;re debugging routing rules then always search using the
sender address, not the recipient.</p>
