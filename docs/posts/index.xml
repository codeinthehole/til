      <description>After opening the 1Password mini window (with cmd + option + \), select the item you want and hit shift + ctrl + cmd + c to copy the MFA code to your clipboard.
This compliments shift + cmd + c, which copies the password.</description>

      <title>How to use AWS profiles that require MFA</title>
      <link>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/how-to-use-aws-profiles-that-require-mfa/</link>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/how-to-use-aws-profiles-that-require-mfa/</guid>
      <description>If you have an AWS organisation and several child AWS accounts that you can assume-role into, you can work around MFA restrictions on the trust relationship using a mfa_serial setting in ~/.aws/config.
Example config:
[profile parent] # Account ID 111111111111 region = eu-west-2 [profile child-account1] # Account ID 222222222222 role_arn = arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::111111111111:mfa/david.winterbottom region = eu-west-1 source_profile = parent  [profile child-account2] # Account ID 333333333333 role_arn = arn:aws:iam::333333333333:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::111111111111:mfa/david.</description>

      <description>Minimising:
  ⌘ + m minimises the active application window.
  Window icon appears in Dock.
  Selecting application via the ⌘ + tab application switcher doesn&amp;rsquo;t restore window.
  Hiding:
  ⌘ + h hides all windows of active application.
  ⌘ + ⌥ + h hides all windows of all applications except the active one (useful).

      <title>About `readonly` Bash variables</title>

      <description>Doing this:
$ readonly myvar=1 means that $myvar can&amp;rsquo;t have its value changed within the global scope.
$ myvar=2 -bash: myvar: readonly variable You can use declare -r to enforce immutability within a local scope (eg within a function body).
See the Linux Shell Scripting Tutorial wiki for basic examples. See this Stack Overflow answer for more details on the differences between readonly and declare -r.</description>

      <description>Bash has a DEBUG signal that you can register a handler for using trap.
As Julia Evans tweeted, you can use this to print a prompt before each command is executed, which allows you to step through a Bash script:
trap &#39;(read -p &amp;quot;[$BASH_SOURCE:$LINENO] $BASH_COMMAND &amp;quot;)&#39; DEBUG </description>

      <title>How to resolve Git rebase conflicts on renamed files</title>
      <link>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/how-to-resolve-git-conflicts-on-renamed-files/</link>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/how-to-resolve-git-conflicts-on-renamed-files/</guid>
      <description>If there&amp;rsquo;s been a large-scale renaming of files in master and you attempt to rebase your pull-request branch, the resulting conflicts can be tricky to resolve. You&amp;rsquo;ll see lots of conflicts of form:
CONFLICT (modify/delete): $FILEPATH deleted in HEAD and modified in $SHA... $COMMIT_MSG One resolution is to manually apply the changes in $SHA to the new filepaths but this is manual and error-prone.
Better is to use git diff to generate patch files and apply these with patch.</description>

      <title>How to use `xargs` with `printf`</title>
      <link>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/how-to-use-xargs-with-printf/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2020 12:47:23 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/how-to-use-xargs-with-printf/</guid>
      <description>This is obvious in retrospect but it hadn&amp;rsquo;t dawned on me that you can use xargs printf to use STDIN as printf arguments. Trivial example:
$ echo world | xargs printf &amp;#34;hello %s&amp;#34; hello world It&amp;rsquo;s useful for building strings from streams of data. Today&amp;rsquo;s usecase was building a pastable Python snippet from a JSON file containing object IDs:
$ cat loggly_events.json | jq &amp;#39;.events[].event.json.object_id&amp;#39; \  | paste -sd, | xargs printf &amp;#34;object_ids = [%s]&amp;#34; object_ids = [4,6,8,2,3,4] Here jq is used to extract a newline-separated stream of IDs which are joined into a CSV-string using paste before being formatted into a Python snippet with printf.</description>

      <title>AWS ASGs have an &#39;instance refresh&#39; feature</title>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/aws-asgs-have-an-instance-refresh-feature/</guid>
      <description>Which lets you replace all the instances in an auto-scaling group, possibly with a new AMI. See the announcement from the AWS Compute Blog.
If you use an immutable infrastructure approach and deploy using AMIs, this provides an alternative deployment mechanism. In contrast to using Terraform&amp;rsquo;s create_before_destroy mechanism, which creates a new auto-scaling group for each deploy, this method would allow a single long-lived ASG to be used.
Looks interesting.</description>

      <description>Refer to the buffer&amp;rsquo;s number using a hash. For example, run:
:read #3to insert the contents of the file linked to buffer 3. Note that a buffer&amp;rsquo;s content isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily the same as the linked file.

 Host Restricts the following declarations (up to the next Host or Match keyword) to be only for those hosts that match one of the patterns given after the keyword. If more than one pattern is provided, they should be separated by whitespace.
 and so you can do this:
Host 10.0.20.* 10.0.28.* 10.0.29.* 10.0.30.* User ubuntu IdentityFile ~/.ssh/xxx/id_rsa ProxyJump some-bastion-host StrictHostKeyChecking no UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null where multiple host patterns are used for one block.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not obvious how to build a Terraform list where an item is only included if some condition is met. One solution is to use flatten along with a conditional expression.
Something like this:
resource &amp;#34;aws_security_group&amp;#34; &amp;#34;this&amp;#34; { ... ingress { ... security_groups = flatten([ aws_security_group.server-type-a.id, var.include_server_type_b ? aws_security_group.server-type-b[*].id : [] ]) } where the server-type-b security group is only included the security_groups list if var.include_server_type_b is truthy.</description>

      <title>Python 3.7 supports postponed evaluation of annotations</title>

      <description>For example, instead of:
import _csv def generate_report(writer: &amp;#39;_csv._writer&amp;#39;): pass you can use:
from __future__ import annotations import _csv def generate_report(writer: _csv._writer): pass and avoid using a string literal for the type annotation.
This follows on from a related TIL about how to specify type annotations for the csv module.

      <description>Adding a type annotation for a &amp;ldquo;writer&amp;rdquo; object created by csv.writer(...) is fiddlier than you might think.
The type of the writer object is _csv.writer which you verify with:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import csv, sys &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; type(csv.writer(sys.stdout)) &amp;lt;class &amp;#39;_csv.writer&amp;#39;&amp;gt; but if you try this:
import _csv def generate_report(writer: _csv.writer): pass mypy complains that:
Function &amp;quot;_csv.writer&amp;quot; is not valid as a type [valid-type]. The correct approach is to use _csv._writer as the type annotation.</description>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/how-to-configure-alfreds-bear-workflow-to-open-notes-in-the-main-window/</guid>
      <description>This applies to the Bear workflow written in Go whose default behaviour (in v1.1.6) is to open notes in a new window rather than the main Bear application window.
To adjust this, after installing and performing the dance of authorising all the workflow scripts, you need to manually edit the workflow property list file and replace new_window=yes with new_window=no.
FYI: the info.plist file can be found in:
~/Library/Application Support/Alfred/Alfred.alfredpreferences/workflows/ or by right clicking on the workflow in Alfred&amp;rsquo;s preferences and selecting &amp;ldquo;Open in Finder&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Using foldmethod=indent is ok but it&amp;rsquo;s better to use the pedrohdz/vim-yaml-folds plugin. The author gives more detail in Vim folding rules for YAML.</description>

      <description>Installation requires switching the DNS servers of your router or device to use the OpenDNS ones. If you create an account, you can customise the degree of filtering and view some simple stats.
This is useful for home networking when you have kids. Unfortunately, the Virgin Media Hub 3.0 I have doesn&amp;rsquo;t support custom DNS settings - you need to use it as a modem with a separate router to achieve that.</description>

      <title>AWS Availability Zones have counter-intuitive IDs</title>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/aws-availability-zones-have-counterintuitive-ids/</guid>
      <description>Today, the AWS Service Health Dashboard referred to an Availability Zone in a way I wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with:
 3:52 AM PDT We are experiencing instance connectivity issues in a single Availability Zone (euw2-az2) in the EU-WEST-2 Region.
 See:
  Here &amp;ldquo;euw2-az2&amp;rdquo; is the &amp;ldquo;Zone ID&amp;rdquo; of the Availability Zone, and the mapping from Zone ID to the more familiar Zone Name is non-obvious. See, for example:
$ aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region eu-west-2 | jq -r &amp;#39;.</description>

      <title>You can rate-limit issues using a Sentry DSN</title>
      <link>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/you-can-ratelimit-issues-using-a-sentry-dsn/</link>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/you-can-ratelimit-issues-using-a-sentry-dsn/</guid>
      <description>If you want to manage how your event quota is consumed with Sentry, you can apply rate limits at the DSN level.
  This lets you apply different rate limiting settings for different parts of your application by using separate DSNs.
See Sentry&amp;rsquo;s docs on the subject.</description>

      <description>In a detail template, you can grab a post&amp;rsquo;s tags with {{ .GetTerms &amp;quot;tags&amp;quot; }}. You can then loop over this and fetch a list of pages with each tag, excluding the current post:
{{ range $tag_pages }} {{ $related_tag_pages := where .Pages &amp;#34;Title&amp;#34; &amp;#34;!=&amp;#34; $.Title }} {{ if $related_tag_pages }} &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other posts about &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{ .Permalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;{{ .Title | markdownify }}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; {{ range $related_tag_pages }} &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{ .RelPermalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;{{ .</description>

      <description>You can manually compare two more open buffers by running:
:windo diffthisThis is an alternative to opening the files with vimdiff. One advantage is that you compare buffers that aren&amp;rsquo;t files (eg text pasted from the clipboard).

      <description>If you use Finder to mark a file as a &amp;ldquo;stationery pad&amp;rdquo; then apps will open a copy of the file. The original file will effectively act as a template.
You can set this flag from the Get Info Finder dialogue:
  This only works when opening a file from Finder, so not that much use to people who live in iTerm (like me).</description>

      <title>You can have SASS asset pipelines in Hugo</title>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/you-can-have-sass-asset-pipelines-in-hugo/</guid>
      <description>Which lets you build a CSS stylesheet via something like:
{{ $style := resources.Get &amp;#34;css/main.scss&amp;#34; | resources.ToCSS }} &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;#34;stylesheet&amp;#34; href=&amp;#34;{{ $style.Permalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt; This is rather nice as you get the usual live reloading functionality when using hugo server. In previous Hugo projects, I had a separate process for rebuilding CSS, which can now be factored away.
This feature is part of Hugo&amp;rsquo;s asset pipeline functionality and has been available since v0.</description>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/about-text-fragments/</guid>
      <description>Modern versions of Chrome and Edge support Text Fragments, which let you specify a text snippet in the URL fragment that the browser can highlight (or bring to the user&amp;rsquo;s attention in another way).
For example, opening https://wicg.github.io/scroll-to-text-fragment/#abstract:~:text=user%20agent%20can%20quickly%20emphasise in Chrome will open the page with &amp;ldquo;user agent can quickly emphasise&amp;rdquo; highlighted:
  Note the :~:text=$query in the URL.
There&amp;rsquo;s a Google-authored Chrome plugin that eases the process of building one of these URLs.</description>

      <title>Renaming a Terraform module is dangerous</title>

      <guid>https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/renaming-a-terraform-module-leads-to-resource-recreation/</guid>
      <description>As the state file uses the module name in identifiers and so a module rename causes Terraform to think all existing resources need to be destroyed and recreated.
You can avoid such needless destruction by editing the state file manually to correct the identifiers.
It might be possible to use terraform mv although I didn&amp;rsquo;t use that approach today.</description>

 Before putting a project or incomplete task away, make notes of what the next thing was that you were going to work on. This lets you bypass that 10 minute orientation getting back into the project the next time you pick it up.
 This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve done for a while.
There&amp;rsquo;s various other ways of doing the same thing, such as:

Examples:
 https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Afrankieboyle%20min_faves%3A10000 https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Afesshole%20min_faves%3A400  There&amp;rsquo;s also a min_retweets filter which can be used for a similar purpose.</description>
