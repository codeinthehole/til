<blockquote>
<p>Before putting a project or incomplete task away, make notes of what the next
thing was that you were going to work on. This lets you bypass that 10 minute
orientation getting back into the project the next time you pick it up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve done for a while.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s various other ways of doing the same thing, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaving a failing test</li>
<li>Leaving an incomplete sentence</li>
</ul>
<p>In my Trello cards, I like to regularly add comments saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s done</li>
<li>What the next thing to do is</li>
</ul>
