            <h1>A better technique for roasting chicken</h1>
        </header><p>There&rsquo;s <a href="https://blog.thermoworks.com/chicken/chicken-internal-temps-everything-you-need-to-know/">a great article on cooking chicken</a> by
ThermoWorks, from which I learnt a few things.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR: use a pull temperature of 63℃ when roasting a chicken, and rest
uncovered for ten minutes.</strong></p>
<h2 id="accurate-measurement">Accurate measurement</h2>
<p>To follow any of the following advice, you&rsquo;re going to need a digital food
thermometer like a <a href="https://thermapen.co.uk/thermapen-thermometers/1-46-thermapen-classic-thermometer.html">thermapen</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pull-vs-final-temperatures">Pull vs final temperatures</h2>
<p>Food continues cooking after it has been removed from the oven in a process
known as carryover cooking. Hence it&rsquo;s important to distinguish between two
temperatures thresholds:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pull temperature</em>: the minimum internal temperature when you remove from the
oven.</li>
<li><em>Final temperature</em>: the max that the minimum internal temperature reaches
after removing from the oven.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most advice on internal temperatures refers to final temperatures and it&rsquo;s easy
to conflate the two (and overcook food by waiting too long to remove it from the
oven).</p>
<h2 id="safety-vs-taste">Safety vs taste</h2>
<p>The standard safety recommendation is to cook chicken until the minimum internal
temperature (e.g. deep in the breast) is 74℃ as all foodborne bacteria
pasteurise (i.e. die) at this temperature.</p>
<p>Regrettably, chicken breast meat is overcooked at this temperature and starting
to turn stringy.</p>
<p>But bacterial death is a function of temperature <em>and time</em>. The same level of
safety can be achieved by cooking the meat to a lower temperature and then
holding the temperature at or above that level for a period of time. As shown in
the below table, holding the internal temperature to 63.3℃ for 8 minutes will
kill all bacteria but avoids overcooking.</p>

<p>Without specialist equipment, it&rsquo;s not possible to hold the internal temperature
at a fixed level. It will continue to rise during carryover cooking.</p>
<p>Hence the best approach is to remove the bird from the oven at a lower
temperature and allow the resting period to maintain a high enough temperature
to kill any bacteria but avoid the breast meat overcooking.</p>
<h2 id="some-skill-still-required">Some skill still required</h2>
<p>Some judgement is required as the amount of carryover cooking depends on the
size of the chicken and the temperature of the oven. These factors determine who
much heat energy is stored in the outer layers of the chicken.</p>
<p>In practice, I have found a medium chicken cooked at 170℃ in a fan oven should
be removed when its minimum internal temperature reaches 63℃ and rested,
uncovered, for around ten minutes. During resting, the minimum internal
temperature will rise to around 70℃.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s useful to continue to measure the internal temperature during resting to
get a feel for how much carryover cooking is occurring, and to inform decisions
about what pull temperature to use.</p>
