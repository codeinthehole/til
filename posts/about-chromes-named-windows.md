Since Google Chrome v88 (Jan 2021), browser windows can be given a name via the `... > More Tools > Name Window...` menu item.

{{< figure src="/images/name-window.png" title="" caption="" alt="Name a Chrome window" >}}

Each window's name is visible in menus, the Dock and—most usefully—the "Application Windows" switcher
(accessed via `ctrl + down` or a configured desktop hot corner).

{{< figure src="/images/application-windows.png" title="" caption="" alt="Application Windows showing window names" >}}

Each window's name is used as the label (instead of the HTML title of the active
tab):

{{< figure src="/images/application-windows-label.png" title="" caption="" alt="Application Window label" >}}

This is useful if you use Chrome windows to group related tabs (which is how
I work). It's best combined with
the [tab grouping](https://blog.google/products/chrome/manage-tabs-with-google-chrome/) functionality which lets you assign a _visible_ name
to the window too:

{{< figure src="/images/tab-group-name.png" title="" caption="" alt="Tab group name" >}}

Rather than click through the menus, it's possible to assign a more convenient keyboard
shortcut for naming a window using MacOS's "App Shortcuts" functionality:

{{< figure src="/images/name-window-chrome-shortcut.png" title="" caption="" alt="name window chrome shortcut" >}}

Note, you don't see the window names in the Navigator view (`ctrl + up`), only the Application
Windows view.
