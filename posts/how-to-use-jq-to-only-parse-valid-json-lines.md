Suppose you have a stream of text comprising JSON and non-JSON lines â€” e.g:

```sh
$ cat example.txt
This is plain text
{"message": "This is JSON"}
```

and you want to pretty-print the JSON lines to make the stream more readable.

Piping this into `jq` fails because the first line is not valid JSON:

```sh
$ cat example.txt | jq
parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 5
```

But you use `jq`'s `fromjson` filter in a `try/catch` block to format the JSON
lines and ignore the others:

```sh
$ cat example.txt | jq -R '. as $line | try (fromjson) catch $line'
"This is plain text"
{
  "message": "This is JSON"
}
```

This works well when

where the initial log lines are not JSON formatted.
