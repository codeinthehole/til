You can insert a `⌘` character using the
[Character Viewer](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp1560/mac)
pop-up.

But the characters for macOS meta-keys like command and option have unusual
names which makes them hard to find by searching. Their names are:

- `⌘` - "PLACE OF INTEREST"
- `⇧` - "UPWARDS WHITE ARROW"
- `⇪` - "UPWARDS WHITE ARROW FROM BAR"
- `⌃` - "UP ARROWHEAD"
