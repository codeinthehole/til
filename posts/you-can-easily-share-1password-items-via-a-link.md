People often ask about where certain credentials are in 1Password and I've only
just discovered each item has a link that can be shared.

In the 1Password app, there's a "Copy link" option in the share drop-down:

{{< figure src="/images/1password-copy-link.png" title="" caption="" alt="Copy link" >}}

To get the link from 1Password mini, use the "Pin on Screen" option for an item
to get access to the share button.

This feature only works with a Business 1Password plan.
