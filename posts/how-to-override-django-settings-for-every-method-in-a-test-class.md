title: "How to override Django's settings for every method in a test class"

Django's [`override_settings` decorator][override_settings] only works on
functions and methods in [subclasses of `unittest.TestCase`][subclass].

But it's common to group tests in plain Python classes when using Pytest, which
means `override_settings` can't be used to decorate a class and override
settings for every test method.

Instead, do this with an `autouse=True` fixture and the [`settings`
fixture][settings_fixture] provided by the [`pytest-django`][pytest_django]
package.

For example:

```py
import pytest
from django.conf import settings as django_settings

class TestAutouseFixture:
    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
    def configure_settings(self, settings):
        # The `settings` argument is a fixture provided by pytest-django.
        settings.FOO = "bar"

    def test_one(self):
        assert django_settings.FOO == "bar"

    def test_two(self):
        assert django_settings.FOO == "bar"
```

ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Oops ‚Äî turns out I learnt this
[last year too](/posts/you-can-have-classscoped-autouse-pytest-fixtures/),
although my example then used `override_settings` as a context manager.
