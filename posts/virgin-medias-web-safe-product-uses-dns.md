Virgin Media's [Web Safe](https://www.virginmedia.com/help/how-to-use-websafe)
product applies its blocking rules using its DNS servers, the same way the
OpenDNS's [Family Shield](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/) does.
I thought perhaps it was doing something cleverer.

I discovered this while looking for a way to block YouTube during home-schooling
hours (don't ask). Web Safe has some advantages over OpenDNS as it supports a
timer option where its rules are disabled for defined periods each day/week.
