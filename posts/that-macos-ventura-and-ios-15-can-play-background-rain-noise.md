For years, I've been using <https://rain.today> for background rain noise, but I
recently discovered that macOS Ventura and iOS 15 [can play rain noise
too][macos_rain].

In MacOS, there's a "Background Sounds" section in the `System Settings >
Accessibility > Audio` section that allows one of several background sounds to be
chosen.
