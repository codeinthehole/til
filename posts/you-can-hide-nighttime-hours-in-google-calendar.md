In the "Week" view of Google Calendar, it's annoying that each day is listed
from 00:00 onwards. Since I never have events that start before 8am, it's
creates a lot of dead space:

Fortunately, there's a
[Google Calendar Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-calendar-plus/mjelhipeelammmhpghkpigkdonihkakj)
Chrome extension that has an option to limit the working hours that are shown.
