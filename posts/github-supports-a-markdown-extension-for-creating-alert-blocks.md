The syntax is:

```
> [!NOTE]
> This is a note.
```

which renders as:

{{< figure src="/images/github-note-block.png" link="/images/github-note-block.png" title="" caption="" alt="Github note block" >}}

Two other block-types are supported: `[!IMPORTANT]` and `[!WARNING]`.

See the [official docs][docs] for more.
