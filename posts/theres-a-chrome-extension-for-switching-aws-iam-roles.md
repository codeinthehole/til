It's the [AWS Extend Switch Roles](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aws-extend-switch-roles/jpmkfafbacpgapdghgdpembnojdlgkdl?hl=en)
extension.

AWS's Console only keeps your 5 most recent AWS accounts as quick links, which
this extension gives doesn't limit you. 

This is useful if you're using AWS Organizations and have lots of child AWS
accounts that you need to assume roles into.
