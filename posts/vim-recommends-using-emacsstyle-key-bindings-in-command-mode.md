As in, using these command-mode maps:

```txt
" start of line
:cnoremap <C-A>  <Home>
" back one character
:cnoremap <C-B>  <Left>
" delete character under cursor
:cnoremap <C-D>  <Del>
" end of line
:cnoremap <C-E>  <End>
" forward one character
:cnoremap <C-F>  <Right>
" recall newer command-line
:cnoremap <C-N>  <Down>
" recall previous (older) command-line
:cnoremap <C-P>  <Up>
" back one word
:cnoremap <Esc><C-B> <S-Left>
" forward one word
:cnoremap <Esc><C-F> <S-Right>
```
