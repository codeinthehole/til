If you use Finder to mark a file as a "stationery pad" then apps will open a
copy of the file. The original file will effectively act as a template. 

You can set this flag from the `Get Info` Finder dialogue:

{{< figure src="/images/stationery-pad-option.png" title="" caption="" alt="" >}}

This only works when opening a file from Finder, so not that much use to
people who live in iTerm (like me).
