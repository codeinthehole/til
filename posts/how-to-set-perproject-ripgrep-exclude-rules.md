In some projects, you want `ripgrep` to ignore some files that aren't in
`.gitignore` â€” things like statically generated files in a Hugo site (like this
one). You can do this by adding them to a local `.ignore` file.

This also works for [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

This ensures Vim's `:grep` and `:Files` (via
[`fzf.vim`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)) commands don't find irrelevant files.
