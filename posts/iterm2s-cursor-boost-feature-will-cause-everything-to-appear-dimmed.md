I had inadvertently moved the "Cursor Boost" slider to a high level and the terminal
became very dim and hard to read. Resetting the slider to zero fixed the issue.

As noted in [this Google Groups
conversation](https://groups.google.com/g/iterm2-discuss/c/sVjKI3VqRcs), "Cursor
Boost" could more accurately be called "Dim everything except the
Cursor" and avoid this confusion.
