Minimising:

- `⌘ + m` minimises the _active application window_.

- Window icon appears in Dock.

- Selecting application via the `⌘ + tab` application switcher doesn't restore
  window.

Hiding:

- `⌘ + h` hides _all_ windows of active application.

- `⌘ + ⌥ + h` hides _all_ windows of all applications except the active one
  (useful).

- Window icon not show in Dock.

- Selecting application via the `⌘ + tab` application switcher restores window.
