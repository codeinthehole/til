You can do searches like:

```txt
from:frankieboyle min_faves:10000
```

to see, for example, the best tweets from a given account. It works really well
-- you just need to pick an appropriate minimum value for the account.

Examples:

- https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Afrankieboyle%20min_faves%3A10000
- https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Afesshole%20min_faves%3A400

There's also a `min_retweets` filter which can be used for a similar purpose.
