Mypy [can be configured](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html#unreachable-code) to raise an error when it finds unreachable code.
This is a useful check and can highlight several categories of bug.

To enable, ensure your `setup.cfg` includes:

```ini
[mypy]
warn_unreachable = true
```
